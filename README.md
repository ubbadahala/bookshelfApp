# bookshelfApp


This is my basic front-end website project that I've learned and submit at dicoding.com
The course that I took there is about "Learn to Create Front-End Web for Beginners". 
Inside this repository, there is an HTML file along with CSS and JavaScript files that are used to build this website.




Talking about the website 💁‍♂️ 
this project is built for managing book data like a bookshelf. In this site, you can do some stuffs like




✅ Add book info (title, author, year, and page),

📝 Edit book info, and

❌ Remove book info.




Don't need to worry about losing the data when you close the tab browser or the browser itself since this website use localStorage in the JavaScript code to store your data. 
So, may this repository could inspire you if you're planning to build a similar website. 
Enjoy the web and have a great day! :)
