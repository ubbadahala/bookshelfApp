# bookshelfApp
This is my basic front-end website project that I've learned and submit at dicoding.com
The course that I took there is about "Learn to Create Front-End Web for Beginners".
Inside this repository, there are HTML file along with CSS and JavaScript file that used to build this website.

Talking about the website, this project is built for managing book data like a bookshelf. You can add, edit, and remove book data in the bookshelf and don't need to worry about losing the data when you close the tab browser or the browser itself since this website use localStorage in the JavaScript code. So, may this repository could inspire you if you're planning to build a similar website. Enjoy the web and have a great day! :)
